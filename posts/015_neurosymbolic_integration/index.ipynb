        "In the early decades of AI (1960s-1980s), symbolic approaches dominated. Researchers built expert systems, logical reasoners, and knowledge bases. The vision: encode human knowledge as rules and let machines derive conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "This worked... sort of. Expert systems could diagnose diseases and configure computers. But they were **brittle**: any situation not anticipated by the rules caused failure. And they faced the **knowledge acquisition bottleneck**: everything had to be manually encoded by experts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Neural networks and deep learning changed the equation. Instead of manually engineering features, let the model learn them. The result: breakthroughs in vision, speech, translation, and now general language understanding. Deep learning scales with data and compute in ways symbolic systems don't.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Counting and simple arithmetic**: \"How many 'r's are in 'strawberry'?\" is surprisingly hard for language models. Tokenization obscures character-level structure, and attention doesn't implement algorithms cleanly.\n",
        "\n",
