        "\n",
        "To understand VC decisions, understand the incentives.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Power laws**: VC returns are dominated by a tiny fraction of investments. The best deal in a fund might return more than all other deals combined. VCs optimize for finding outliers, not avoiding failures.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Portfolio construction**: A typical fund makes 20-40 investments. Most will fail or return 1-2\u00d7. The fund needs 1-3 massive wins (10-100\u00d7) to hit its return target.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Fund economics**: VCs charge ~2% annual management fee and ~20% of profits (carry). Limited partners (LPs) expect returns of 3\u00d7 their capital over 10 years. Anything less, and LPs won't re-invest.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Implications for founders**:\n",
        "- VCs won't invest in \"good companies\" that can't be huge. You need a path to 10\u00d7 or more.\n",
        "- VCs would rather miss a good company than invest in a mediocre one. Passing is easy; regret is painful but infrequent.\n",

        "VCs claim to evaluate many things. In practice, a few dimensions dominate:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Team**: Who are you? Do you have relevant experience? Do you seem capable of executing? Are you coachable? Do you have technical depth in AI if it's an AI company?\n",
        "\n",
        "For AI companies: VCs want to see that founders understand the technology, not just the application. Can you speak fluently about models, training, inference, and the frontier? If you can't, you need a technical co-founder who can.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Market**: Is this market large enough to produce a huge company? Is it growing? Is it winnable by a startup or controlled by incumbents?\n",
        "\n",
        "For AI companies: Markets that didn't exist before AI (autonomous vehicles, protein design) are attractive. Markets where AI is a feature (adding AI to existing software categories) are harder\u2014incumbents can add features.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Traction**: What have you built? Who's using it? Are they paying? Are they retaining? How fast is it growing?\n",
        "\n",
        "For AI companies: Demos don't count. VCs have seen too many impressive demos that collapse in production. Show real usage, preferably with revenue.\n",

        "\n",

        "**Vote or consensus**: Different firms have different decision processes. Some require unanimous partner approval; others allow individual partner conviction.\n",
