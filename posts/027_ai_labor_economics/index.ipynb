        "The most useful mental model for thinking about automation comes from labor economics: **jobs are bundles of tasks**.\n",
        "\n",
        "David Autor's framework distinguishes:\n",
        "- **Routine tasks**: Predictable, rule-following activities that can be codified. Clerical work, assembly line steps.\n",
        "- **Non-routine manual tasks**: Physical activities requiring flexibility and sensorimotor skill. Janitorial work, construction.\n",
        "- **Non-routine cognitive tasks**: Abstract reasoning, creativity, interpersonal interaction. Management, medicine, art.\n",
        "\n",
        "Traditional automation (pre-AI) attacked routine tasks. Assembly robots replaced repetitive manufacturing. Software replaced clerical processing. This led to **job polarization**: growth in high-skill cognitive jobs and low-skill manual jobs, with the middle hollowed out.\n",
        "\n",
        "AI is different because it attacks non-routine cognitive tasks. It writes, codes, analyzes, and creates. This changes which parts of the task distribution are vulnerable.\n",

        "\n",
        "When a technology affects a task, two outcomes are possible:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Substitution**: The technology replaces human labor. Demand for humans doing that task falls.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Complementarity**: The technology amplifies human productivity. Demand for humans doing that task rises because each worker is more valuable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The same technology can have different effects on different tasks, even within the same job.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider a radiologist. AI might substitute for \"read scans for common abnormalities\" (AI can do this) while complementing \"communicate with patients\" and \"handle unusual cases\" (AI provides decision support but humans remain essential). The net effect on radiologist employment depends on which tasks dominate the work.\n",
        "\n",
        "Historical examples show both patterns:\n",
        "- **ATMs and bank tellers**: ATMs substituted for cash dispensing, reducing tellers per branch. But cheaper branches increased total branches, and remaining tellers shifted to customer service. Net employment was roughly flat.\n",
        "- **Spreadsheets and accountants**: Spreadsheets made accounting tasks faster, reducing the labor needed per task. But lower costs increased demand for accounting services. More accountants are employed now than before spreadsheets.\n",
        "\n",
        "The lesson: automation of tasks doesn't directly map to automation of jobs. It depends on demand elasticity, task bundling, and whether technology is primarily complementary or substitutive.\n",

        "- Complex coding (AI accelerates but doesn't replace expert programmers)\n",
