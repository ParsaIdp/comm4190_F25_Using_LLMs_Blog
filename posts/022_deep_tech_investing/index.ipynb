        "\n",
        "**Google**: Started as a Stanford PhD project in 1996. Took years to find a business model (AdWords launched 2000). Became the most valuable company by market cap. From research to dominance: ~10 years.\n",
        "\n",

        "Traditional VC funds have structural mismatches with deep tech:\n",
        "\n",
        "**10-year fund life**: VC funds typically have 10-year terms. Deep tech might need 15-20 years. This creates pressure to exit earlier than optimal.\n",

        "**Power law focus**: VCs want companies that can scale quickly to massive outcomes. Deep tech often has longer, more linear growth curves.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Partner expertise**: Most VCs are trained in software and business models, not physics, biology, or hardware. Evaluating deep tech requires different expertise.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Follow-on dynamics**: Deep tech needs multiple large rounds over many years. VCs need to reserve capital for follow-ons, limiting how much they can deploy initially.\n",
