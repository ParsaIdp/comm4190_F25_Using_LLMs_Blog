Common designs include McKibben muscles (braided tubes that contract when pressurized) and pneu-nets (networks of channels that bend when inflated). Pneumatics can be fast and powerful, but they require bulky external compressors.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs)** are essentially compliant capacitors. When voltage is applied, electrostatic forces squeeze the elastomer, causing it to expand in area. DEAs are fast, efficient, and fully solid-state, but they require high voltages (kilovolts) and are prone to electrical breakdown.\n",

        "\n",

        "**Jamming-based mechanisms** use granular material (like coffee grounds) in a membrane. When a vacuum is applied, the grains jam together and the structure becomes rigid. Release the vacuum and it's soft again. This enables grippers that conform to objects, then lock in place.\n",
