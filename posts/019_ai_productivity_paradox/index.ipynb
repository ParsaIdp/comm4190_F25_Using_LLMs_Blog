        "\n",
        "Then, in the late 1990s, productivity spiked. The returns arrived, just delayed. Explanations for the delay include:\n",

        "- **Measurement lags**: Statistics take time to capture new technologies\n",
        "- **Adoption lags**: Technology must diffuse through the economy\n",

        "**Quality adjustment**: If software is 10\u00d7 better but costs the same, output should be counted as higher. But how do you measure \"10\u00d7 better\"? Statistical agencies try to quality-adjust, but it's imperfect and subjective.\n",
