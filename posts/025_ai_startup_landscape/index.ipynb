        "**Infrastructure**: Compute, chips, cloud, training infrastructure. Players: NVIDIA, cloud providers, CoreWeave. High capex, high margins for winners, brutal for losers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Models**: Foundation models, fine-tuning, specialized models. Players: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta (Llama). High R&D costs, network effects from developer ecosystems.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Tools and platforms**: APIs, orchestration, evaluation, deployment. Players: LangChain, Weights & Biases, Hugging Face. Developer adoption as the moat.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Applications**: End-user products built on AI. Players: thousands of startups, plus incumbents adding AI features. Closest to customers, but often dependent on layers below.\n",
        "\n",
        "Value concentration shifts over time. Early, models captured most value. As models commoditize, applications and infrastructure may capture more. Figuring out where value will concentrate is the key strategic question.\n",

        "The base models are commoditizing faster than expected:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Open-source models**: LLaMA, Mistral, and others have reached near-parity with proprietary models for many tasks. If the best model is free, the API provider can't charge a premium.\n",
        "\n",
        "**API price wars**: OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are cutting prices rapidly. Input tokens went from $0.03 to $0.001 in two years. Inference is becoming cheap.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Data moats**: Proprietary data that's hard to replicate. Bloomberg has financial data; OSHA has regulatory data; hospitals have medical records. If your product generates unique, valuable data, that's a moat.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Workflow embedding**: Products that become part of daily workflow are sticky. Once your tool is integrated into CI/CD pipelines, document workflows, or customer service systems, switching is expensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Vertical integration**: Own the whole experience in a niche. Vertical AI companies can optimize across the stack for their specific domain\u2014better than horizontal providers can.\n",

        "**Network effects**: Two-sided marketplaces, collaboration tools, or social products where value increases with users. Hard to create in AI but powerful when achieved.\n",
        "\n",

        "When OpenAI ships plugins and GPTs, when Anthropic improves Claude, your \"thin wrapper\" disappears into their platform. You didn't build defensibility.\n",

        "**CAC/LTV inversion**: Customer acquisition cost exceeds lifetime value. Easy to do in AI: pay for marketing, acquire users, but users churn when the novelty wears off.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Demo-to-production gap**: Your demo is impressive, but reliability in production is terrible. Hallucination rates, latency, cost, and edge cases kill you in real deployment.\n",

        "**Commoditization from above**: You build a specialized AI tool; the foundation model provider absorbs your functionality into their base offering. Game over.\n",
