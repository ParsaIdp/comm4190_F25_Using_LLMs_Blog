<p>Raising venture capital is opaque. Founders get rejections without understanding why. VCs seem to pattern-match in mysterious ways. But there’s more structure than it appears. Understanding how VCs actually evaluate companies—especially AI companies—helps founders prepare, pitch, and navigate the process.</p>
<section id="the-vc-business-model" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-vc-business-model">The VC Business Model</h2>
<p>To understand VC decisions, understand the incentives.</p>
<p><strong>Power laws</strong>: VC returns are dominated by a tiny fraction of investments. The best deal in a fund might return more than all other deals combined. VCs optimize for finding outliers, not avoiding failures.</p>
<p><strong>Portfolio construction</strong>: A typical fund makes 20-40 investments. Most will fail or return 1-2×. The fund needs 1-3 massive wins (10-100×) to hit its return target.</p>
<p><strong>Fund economics</strong>: VCs charge ~2% annual management fee and ~20% of profits (carry). Limited partners (LPs) expect returns of 3× their capital over 10 years. Anything less, and LPs won’t re-invest.</p>
<p><strong>Implications for founders</strong>: - VCs won’t invest in “good companies” that can’t be huge. You need a path to 10× or more. - VCs would rather miss a good company than invest in a mediocre one. Passing is easy; regret is painful but infrequent. - VCs are looking for conviction about exceptional outcomes, not certainty about moderate ones.</p>
</section>
<section id="evaluation-heuristics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="evaluation-heuristics">Evaluation Heuristics</h2>
<p>VCs claim to evaluate many things. In practice, a few dimensions dominate:</p>
<p><strong>Team</strong>: Who are you? Do you have relevant experience? Do you seem capable of executing? Are you coachable? Do you have technical depth in AI if it’s an AI company?</p>
<p>For AI companies: VCs want to see that founders understand the technology, not just the application. Can you speak fluently about models, training, inference, and the frontier? If you can’t, you need a technical co-founder who can.</p>
<p><strong>Market</strong>: Is this market large enough to produce a huge company? Is it growing? Is it winnable by a startup or controlled by incumbents?</p>
<p>For AI companies: Markets that didn’t exist before AI (autonomous vehicles, protein design) are attractive. Markets where AI is a feature (adding AI to existing software categories) are harder—incumbents can add features.</p>
<p><strong>Traction</strong>: What have you built? Who’s using it? Are they paying? Are they retaining? How fast is it growing?</p>
<p>For AI companies: Demos don’t count. VCs have seen too many impressive demos that collapse in production. Show real usage, preferably with revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Differentiation</strong>: What do you have that others don’t? Why will you win against competitors (including future ones)?</p>
<p>For AI companies: This is the crux. “We have a better model” is weak—models commoditize. “We have proprietary data” or “We own the workflow” is strong.</p>
</section>
<section id="ai-specific-evaluation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ai-specific-evaluation">AI-Specific Evaluation</h2>
<p>AI companies get additional scrutiny:</p>
<p><strong>Model ownership</strong>: Do you train your own models or use APIs? Own models = more differentiation but more cost. API-dependent = lower cost but thin differentiation.</p>
<p><strong>Data strategy</strong>: Where does your training/fine-tuning data come from? Is it proprietary? Does the product generate more? Data is the most discussed form of moat in AI.</p>
<p><strong>Technical depth</strong>: Can the team actually innovate at the model level, or are they “prompt engineers”? The deepest expertise commands the most respect.</p>
<p><strong>Moat durability</strong>: VCs are paranoid about OpenAI/Google/Meta releasing capabilities that destroy your differentiation. You need a story for why you’ll stay ahead or why the race doesn’t matter (because you own something they don’t).</p>
<p><strong>Unit economics in AI</strong>: Compute costs are high. VCs want to see that you can deliver value profitably. If you spend $1 on inference for every $0.50 in revenue, you’re in trouble.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-partner-meeting" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-partner-meeting">The Partner Meeting</h2>
<p>Inside a VC firm, decisions are made in partner meetings. Here’s how they typically work:</p>
<p><strong>Champion</strong>: One partner (the one who met you) presents the deal to others. They’ve already done initial diligence and are advocating for investment.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong>: Other partners ask questions, poke holes, share concerns. Standard objections: “market too small,” “why them,” “seen this before,” “too early/late.”</p>
<p><strong>Vote or consensus</strong>: Different firms have different decision processes. Some require unanimous partner approval; others allow individual partner conviction.</p>
<p><strong>Time pressure</strong>: Competitive deals (multiple VCs interested) force faster decisions. Slow deals with no competition allow more diligence—and often lead to passes.</p>
<p>For founders: - Your champion needs ammunition to defend you. Give them clear, memorable points to make in the meeting. - Anticipate the objections. “Why can’t OpenAI do this?” has to be answered. - The partner meeting is the decision point. Everything before is filtering.</p>
</section>
<section id="pattern-matching" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pattern-matching">Pattern Matching</h2>
<p>VCs pattern-match, consciously or not. They recognize archetypes:</p>
<p><strong>Positive archetypes</strong>: - “Second-time founder who learned from previous attempt” - “Deep technical expert from top lab who sees opportunity” - “Industry insider who understands the problem better than anyone” - “Former big-tech PM who knows how to scale products”</p>
<p><strong>Negative archetypes</strong>: - “First-time founder who’s never shipped anything” - “Business person pitching technical product without technical co-founder” - “Pivot from unrelated domain with no evident expertise” - “Big vision, no traction, been at it for two years”</p>
<p>This pattern-matching is both rational (based on evidence about what predicts success) and biased (based on limited samples and flawed heuristics). It’s imperfect, but it’s real.</p>
</section>
<section id="red-flags-and-green-flags" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="red-flags-and-green-flags">Red Flags and Green Flags</h2>
<p><strong>Red flags</strong> that kill deals: - Founders who can’t articulate why they’ll win - No answer to “what’s your differentiation?” - Defensiveness about technology or traction questions - Unrealistic financial projections with no grounding - Co-founder conflict or recent departures - Dependent on single customer or single model provider</p>
<p><strong>Green flags</strong> that advance deals: - Founders who demonstrate clear thinking about market dynamics - Strong retention or engagement metrics (even at small scale) - Unusual insight about customers or technology - Existing relationships that will become customers - Team with previous working history together - Competitive process (other VCs are interested)</p>
</section>
<section id="due-diligence" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="due-diligence">Due Diligence</h2>
<p>If a partner meeting goes well, due diligence follows:</p>
<p><strong>Technical diligence</strong>: VCs (or their advisors) evaluate your technology. Can you actually do what you claim? Is the architecture sound? Is the team capable?</p>
<p>For AI companies: Be ready to walk through model architecture, training methodology, evaluation results, and roadmap. “It’s a transformer” isn’t enough. What did you do that’s hard?</p>
<p><strong>Commercial diligence</strong>: Talk to customers. Are they actually using the product? What do they say about you? Would they pay more?</p>
<p><strong>Reference checks</strong>: The VC calls people who’ve worked with you. This is where skeletons emerge. Be honest about your history.</p>
<p><strong>Legal diligence</strong>: Cap table, IP ownership, employment contracts, data rights. Make sure your house is in order before it’s inspected.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-founders-control-and-dont" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-founders-control-and-dont">What Founders Control and Don’t</h2>
<p><strong>You control</strong>: - Clarity of your pitch - Quality of materials (deck, demo, data room) - Your responsiveness and professionalism - How you handle objections and follow-ups - Preparation and knowledge of your own business</p>
<p><strong>You don’t control</strong>: - Whether your market matches their thesis - Their fund dynamics (too early in fund, too late, already invested in competitor) - Partner dynamics (who champions you, who’s skeptical) - Macro conditions (fundraising environment, public market valuation comparables)</p>
<p>Many rejections have nothing to do with you. Funds pass on good companies for strategic reasons. Don’t take every “no” as a judgment on your startup.</p>
</section>
<section id="advice-for-founders" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="advice-for-founders">Advice for Founders</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Run a tight process</strong>: Talk to many VCs in parallel. Create competitive pressure. Don’t go exclusive early.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Know your numbers</strong>: Metrics, unit economics, growth rates. VCs respect founders who know their business cold.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tell a story</strong>: Not just what you’re building, but why now, why you, and what’s the end state. Narratives stick.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Anticipate the AI-specific questions</strong>: What’s your moat? What if OpenAI ships this? Why can’t you be replaced by a prompt?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get introductions</strong>: Cold outreach rarely works. Warm introductions from trusted sources are the best path to partner meetings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Know when to walk</strong>: Some VCs will waste your time. If they’re slow, unresponsive, or asking for unreasonable diligence without commitment, move on.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Fundraising is a sales process. Treat it systematically, not emotionally.</p>
