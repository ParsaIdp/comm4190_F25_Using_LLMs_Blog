        "Bennett ends with a move that is both obvious and surprisingly rare: he treats the “superintelligence” question as the continuation of the same staircase. If intelligence evolved through breakthroughs, it’s natural to ask whether we’re near the next one. His candidate is a medium shift: intelligence moving from biology to digital systems.\n",

        "Biological minds are constrained in ways we normalize. Neurons are slow compared to silicon. Brains are expensive and thermally limited. They’re embedded in bodies that require maintenance, reproduction, and survival. And most importantly: brains are not easily copyable. A human mind cannot fork itself into ten variants and see which one learns faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "Digital minds relax these constraints. Copying is cheap. Iteration is fast. Architectures and training regimes can be modified. That changes what “evolution” looks like. Selection pressure can operate over designs and training methods, and improvements can propagate instantly by copying rather than slowly by reproduction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bennett’s point about copyability sharpens the intuition: if an intelligence can fork, explore development paths in parallel, keep what works, and discard what fails, the optimization dynamics accelerate. The system becomes “faster at becoming better,” not just “better.” That is the core discontinuity he wants you to feel.\n",

        "He also makes a pragmatic claim about near-term shape. Even if a digital superintelligence is not brain-like internally, it will likely inherit many human-like structures early on because it is built by humans and deployed among humans. Interface constraints matter. If you want an AI to operate in human institutions, it will need to model human goals, communicate in human languages, and navigate human multi-agent dynamics. That pressures it toward mentalizing-like and language-like capabilities whether or not it uses our exact anatomy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then Bennett lands the plane on the only honest ending: values. Biology provided the objective for most of evolutionary history. In engineered systems, we provide the objective. Optimization power without stable objective specification is not neutral; it produces highly competent pursuit of whatever you accidentally or carelessly set as the target. Bennett’s staircase therefore ends as a demand for seriousness: if we are building the next step, the central question becomes not only what is possible, but what should be optimized and under what constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you want a crisp way to say this in a professor conversation: as systems get more capable, the hardest problem shifts from “can we make it learn?” to “can we keep its learned behavior aligned with what we actually want over long horizons and under distribution shift?” Bennett doesn’t solve alignment, but he frames why it becomes the dominant question in a world where intelligence is scalable and copyable.\n",
