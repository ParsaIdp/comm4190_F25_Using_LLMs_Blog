        "Speaking is where Bennett stops treating brains as isolated optimizers and starts treating humans as participants in a collective learning system. Language is not just communication in his framing. It is the mechanism that aligns internal simulations across individuals, and the alignment enables cumulative culture.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two ideas do the heavy lifting: (1) humans evolved a developmental pipeline that makes language learnable, and (2) language acts as a low-bandwidth interface to high-dimensional internal models.\n",

        "On learnability, Bennett emphasizes proto-conversations and joint attention. Proto-conversations are the turn-taking rhythms that appear before full speech: the infant and caregiver already coordinate timing and expectation. Joint attention is the active work of ensuring shared reference. The child doesn’t just notice an object; the child notices that the adult notices it too. That “we are aligned” fact is what makes a label unambiguous.\n",
        "\n",
        "This matters because raw scenes are wildly ambiguous. If you hear a word while looking at a room, what does the word refer to? The cup? The color? The action? The relation? Joint attention collapses the hypothesis space by constructing a teaching context. The child’s environment is not a passive dataset; it is an interactive training regime engineered by caregivers and enforced by the child’s own drive to be understood.\n",
        "\n",
        "As an ML person, I read this as a biological argument for why data quality is not “just more tokens.” The distribution is actively shaped for learnability. The learner actively shapes what data it receives. That is an underappreciated difference between human language acquisition and most current-scale language modeling.\n",

        "On function, Bennett’s “tethering simulations” metaphor is right. A sentence is not a high-bandwidth dump of an internal movie. It’s a compressed control signal that causes the listener to reconstruct the relevant movie inside their own generative model. Words behave like handles into shared structure; grammar binds handles into relations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once this works, culture becomes an external memory system. Skills, tools, norms, and explanations survive beyond any one individual. Bennett calls this a “hive mind” in spirit: not because humans lose individuality, but because the unit of intelligence becomes partially collective. The population becomes a distributed optimizer over ideas, with language as the protocol that moves partial solutions between brains.\n",
        "\n",
        "This also creates a feedback loop that accelerates intelligence: better communication improves coordination; coordination enables more complex tools and institutions; those tools change the developmental environment; and the new environment selects for even better learning and communication. Bennett is telling an evolutionary scaling story: intelligence doesn’t only scale by adding neurons; it scales by adding transmission and accumulation.\n",

        "The most interesting place to press Bennett here is how language relates to simulation and mentalizing. His scaffold suggests language is not the root capability; it is a coordination layer built on top of reinforcement, simulation, and mind-modeling. That gives you a clean way to compare humans and current AI systems:\n",
        "\n",
        "- LLMs show language can carry immense structure and can induce impressive competence.\n",
        "- Bennett’s story suggests the strongest generality comes when language is coupled to objectives, feedback, world models, and multi-agent inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "So the question for modern AI is not “does language matter?” It obviously does. The question is whether language-only training reliably yields the deeper agentic stack, or whether you eventually need the other ingredients directly (embodied objectives, interactive feedback, explicit planning, social inference). Bennett’s book doesn’t answer that, but it gives you a coherent set of axes to discuss it without handwaving.\n",
