I'm a researcher and engineer working at the intersection of AI, biology, and robotics. This blog is where I think through ideas—sometimes technical deep-dives into transformer architectures or diffusion models, sometimes broader explorations of how intelligence evolved or where it might be heading.

My interests span the stack: from low-level inference optimization and CUDA kernels to high-level questions about alignment, consciousness, and the economic implications of increasingly capable AI systems. I'm particularly drawn to problems where biology and computation meet—protein folding, synthetic biology, embodied cognition.

I write to understand. If any of these posts are useful to you, even better.
